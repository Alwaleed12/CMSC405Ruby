# Ruby provides a whole set of I/O related methods in the Kernel module
# a Ruby module is like a java interface.

# The print method prints each parameter its passed to standard out (stdout).
# It does not append a new line to the end of its output.
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"

# Obeservations: The arguments to the print method weren't enclosed in parenthesis.
# Delimiters like the semi-colon weren't, needed at the end of the lines
